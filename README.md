• Perform ELT: load raw data first, then transform within the sandbox.
• Perform ETLT: apply multiple transformations before and after loading.
• Explore the dataset to identify relationships between variables (e.g., age, cholesterol, target).
• Select key variables and propose a predictive model (e.g., logistic regression).
• Split into training, testing, and production datasets.
• Build and execute the model step by step.
